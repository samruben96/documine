# 3. Competitive Landscape

## Agency Management Systems (AMS) - The Foundation

**Market Reality:** 90%+ of independent agencies use an AMS. This is the central hub agents live in.

| System | Strengths | Considerations |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **AMS360 (Vertafore)** | G2's #1 rated 2025, clean interface, easy onboarding | Part of larger ecosystem |
| **EZLynx** | 330+ carrier connections, strong rating engine | Some customization limits |
| **Applied Epic** | Powerful, deep features, robust BI | Steep learning curve |
| **HawkSoft** | User-friendly, excellent support, mobile access | May lack advanced features |
| **NowCerts** | Strong customization, intuitive UI, automated workflows | Variable by agency size |

**Key Insight:** Any new solution must integrate seamlessly with existing AMS platforms. Agents don't want to "toggle between platforms" or "learn new systems."

## AI Document Analysis Solutions

| Solution | Focus | Key Features | Pricing |
|----------|-------|--------------|---------|
| **AlliBot 3.0** | Policy comparison | File upload, Q&A, side-by-side policy comparison (AlliDocs) | Education-focused |
| **Chisel AI** | Document processing | Rapid policy/contract analysis, regulatory paperwork | $79/user/month |
| **V7 Go** | Multi-modal AI | AI Citations for source verification, transparency focus | Enterprise |
| **Kira Systems** | Contract analysis | ML clause extraction, risk provision highlighting | Enterprise |
| **docAnalyzer.ai** | Claims processing | JSON data extraction, claims management integration | Variable |
| **AgentFlow (Multimodal)** | Workflow automation | 100+ insurance templates, multi-agent orchestration | Enterprise |
| **Gradient AI (SAIL)** | Underwriting | Inconsistency detection, document synthesis | Enterprise ($56M Series C) |
| **Sonant AI** | Policy comparison | Free tool for agents, coverage/exclusion identification | Free tier available |

## What Differentiates Winning Solutions

**1. AMS Integration is Non-Negotiable**
> "AMS integration dominates because agents live in their agency management systems. Forcing them to toggle between platforms to rekey submissions saps productivity."

**2. "Invisible Technology" Wins**
> "The winners will be insurers who recognize that agents don't want to learn new systems—they want simplified quoting, binding, and servicing experiences that integrate seamlessly with existing processes."

**3. Accuracy with Transparency**
- V7 Go's "AI Citations" system links every extracted data point to source documents
- This addresses the fundamental challenge: trust and verification

**4. Human-AI Collaboration**
- Tools that make agents MORE productive, not more replaceable
- Agents prefer maintaining control over client relationships
- Policyholder self-service gets lukewarm reception (31% consider it important)

## What Agents DON'T Value

- **Marketing tools** — Only 13-25% rate as extremely important
- **Mobile applications** — Surprisingly weak (27-48% depending on line)
- **Direct insurer-policyholder interactions** — Agents want to stay in control
