# 4. Technology Reliability & Trust

## The Trust Crisis

**Shocking Statistics:**
- **Only 4%** of insurance organizations fully trust AI agents
- **Only 26%** of customers trust the reliability/accuracy of AI advice
- **Only 29%** are comfortable with gen AI virtual agents providing service
- **Only 20%** of organizations have mature AI infrastructure

## The Accuracy Imperative

> "Good AI model accuracy starts at about 70%, but to reliably automate high-risk processes such as insurance claim management, the accuracy needs to be above 95%."

**The Hallucination Problem:**
- OpenAI's most advanced model (o3) hallucinates 33% of the time on PersonQA benchmark
- In insurance, incorrect information affects risk selection, pricing, and claims decisions
- New insurance products now exist specifically to cover AI hallucination liabilities

## What Makes AI Reliable for Insurance

**1. Multi-Layer Verification**
- Multi-model validation
- Human oversight at critical decision points
- Fact-checking protocols
- "Appropriate skepticism" before informing critical decisions

**2. Source Citation & Transparency**
- Every data point linked to source document
- Clear audit trails
- Ability to verify AI outputs against original documents

**3. Continuous Training**
> "AI is not a 'set it and forget it' technology but an iterative process that requires constantly training and retaining models to ensure accuracy."

**4. Insurance-Specific Customization**
- 45% cite insurance-specific model customization as crucial
- Generic solutions "often fail to address industry-specific nuances"
- Models must be trained on appropriate insurance datasets

**5. Agent Hierarchy & Typed Workflows**
- Master, intake, fraud assessor, and policy verification agents
- Logical processes reduce random outputs
- Structured reasoning capabilities

## Adoption Barriers

| Barrier | Prevalence |
|---------|------------|
| Skills and resource constraints | 52% |
| Data challenges | 40% |
| Fear technology won't deliver | 38% |
| Internal resistance to change | 35% |
| Difficulty building business case | 26% |
