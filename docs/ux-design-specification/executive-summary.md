# Executive Summary

**Project:** docuMINE - an AI-powered document analysis platform for independent insurance agents that solves the industry's trust problem with AI.

**Vision:** Agents need AI efficiency but can't trust generic tools with client-facing work because of accuracy concerns and E&O liability exposure. docuMINE delivers speed they can feel AND accuracy they can verify.

**Target Users:** Non-tech-savvy independent agency staff who:
- Have been in insurance for years ("old school" professionals)
- Work with 15+ carriers, each with different formats
- Are skeptical of new technology - they've been burned before
- Need tools that "just work" with zero learning curve
- Value their expertise and want AI to assist, not replace them

**The Magic Moment:** An agent asks "Is flood covered?" and gets the answer in seconds with a direct link to the exact policy language.

**MVP Capabilities:**
1. Document Chat / Q&A with source citations + confidence scoring
2. Side-by-Side Quote Comparison with auto-extraction and gap identification
3. Core Platform (signup, agency accounts, document storage)

**Design Philosophy:** "Invisible Technology" - tools that just work without training, tutorials, or feature tours. Trust through transparency.
