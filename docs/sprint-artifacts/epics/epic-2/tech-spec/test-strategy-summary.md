# Test Strategy Summary

## Test Levels

| Level | Scope | Framework | Coverage |
|-------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Unit | Form validation, Zod schemas | Vitest | All validation rules |
| Integration | Auth flows, database operations | Vitest + Supabase local | Signup, login, reset flows |
| E2E | Complete user journeys | Playwright (post-MVP) | Critical paths |

## Key Test Scenarios

**Signup:**
- Valid form submission creates agency + user
- Duplicate email shows error
- Weak password rejected
- Agency name validation (2-100 chars)

**Login:**
- Valid credentials → redirect to dashboard
- Invalid credentials → generic error
- "Remember me" extends session duration
- Redirect param preserved after login

**Session:**
- Protected routes redirect when unauthenticated
- Session auto-refreshes before expiry
- Logout clears all session data

**Password Reset:**
- Request sends email (verify via test inbox)
- Valid link allows password update
- Expired link shows appropriate error
- New password must meet requirements
