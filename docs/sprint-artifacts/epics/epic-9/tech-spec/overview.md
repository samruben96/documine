# Overview

Epic 9 delivers professional, branded one-pager PDF generation for insurance agents. This transforms docuMINE from a back-office analysis tool into a client-facing productivity multiplier. Agents can analyze documents, compare quotes, and immediately generate polished summaries to share with clients - all without manual formatting.

The feature builds on Epic 7's extraction pipeline and leverages the proven @react-pdf/renderer pattern (Story 7.6). Key additions include agency branding management, a central dashboard hub, and a dedicated one-pager generation page with three entry points: from quote comparison, from document chat, and standalone selection.

**PRD Context:**
- Phase 2 feature: "One-pager generation: Auto-create client-ready comparison summaries from uploaded quotes" (PRD Section: Growth Features)
- FR26: "Users can export comparison results (PDF or structured format)"
- NFR13-16: 95%+ accuracy for extracted data displayed in one-pagers
