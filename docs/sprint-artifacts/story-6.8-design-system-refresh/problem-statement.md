# Problem Statement

The current design system is dominated by slate/grey tones:
- Primary color: `slate-600` (#475569) — too neutral
- Entire palette: Slate-based (slate-50 through slate-800)
- No brand accent color beyond functional colors (emerald/red/amber)
- Spacing inconsistencies in various components
- Feels like "Enterprise Grey Syndrome" — professional but lifeless

**User Feedback:** "Too grey. Not loving the color scheme. Doesn't feel modern."
