#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder by *create-story

# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============

# ===========================================
# FUTURE EPICS (Prioritized Post-MVP Roadmap)
# ===========================================
# Priority Order (as of 2025-12-03):
# F1 ✅ (done via Epic 8) → F2 → F3 → F4 → F5 → F6 → F7 → F8

  # Epic F1: Tech Debt & Optimizations
  # COMPLETED VIA EPIC 8 - 2025-12-03
  # Epic 8 addressed the core tech debt items:
  #   - Security: Function search_path hardening, leaked password protection
  #   - Performance: RLS policy optimization (28 policies), FK indexes
  #   - Rate limiting: API abuse prevention
  #   - Code quality: ESLint fixes, type safety
  # Remaining items (accessibility, observability) deferred to future work
