# Overview

Epic 1 establishes the technical foundation for docuMINE, an AI-powered document analysis platform for independent insurance agents. This epic delivers the complete project scaffolding, database schema with multi-tenant Row Level Security, Supabase client configuration, storage bucket setup, error handling patterns, and deployment pipeline. Upon completion, the development environment will be fully operational, enabling all subsequent feature development.

This foundational work directly enables the platform's core value proposition: trustworthy AI document analysis with source citations and confidence scoring. The architecture prioritizes accuracy-first responses, multi-tenant agency isolation, and zero-learning-curve user experience.
