# Custom Reporting (Phase 2)

> AI-powered commission data normalization and natural language querying.

## Status: Planned (After AI Buddy)

## Overview

Custom Reporting solves the "spreadsheet hell" problem - agents spending hours monthly reconciling commission statements from 15+ carriers, each in different formats.

## The Problem

- Commission statements from 15+ carriers
- Different formats (PDF, Excel, CSV, paper)
- Different column names ("Premium" vs "Written Premium" vs "Ann. Premium")
- Different pay schedules and ID formats
- Hours wasted on manual reconciliation

## The Solution

1. **Upload**: Drag-and-drop Excel/CSV/PDF
2. **AI Normalizes**: Automatically maps columns with user confirmation
3. **Store**: Data accumulates over time
4. **Query**: Natural language questions through AI Buddy
5. **Generate**: Charts and exports on demand

## Report Types

| Report Type | Question It Answers |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Commission Summary | "How much did I make this month, by carrier?" |
| Production Trends | "Is my book growing or shrinking?" |
| Carrier Mix | "Am I too dependent on one carrier?" |
| Policy Retention | "Which policies are up for renewal?" |
| Producer Performance | "Which of my agents is producing?" |
| Forecast | "What should I expect next quarter?" |
