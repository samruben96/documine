# Executive Summary

docuMINE is an AI-powered document analysis platform purpose-built for independent insurance agents. It solves the industry's fundamental problem: agents need AI efficiency but can't trust generic tools with client-facing work.

Independent agents juggle 15+ carrier relationships, each with different document formats, coverage structures, and terminology. They waste hours manually hunting through policies, comparing quotes side-by-side, and verifying coverage details. Generic AI tools have failed them - hallucinated coverage details, missed exclusions, and no way to verify answers.

docuMINE is different because it was built FOR insurance agents from the ground up. Every answer comes with source citations linking to the exact document location. Confidence scoring tells agents when to trust and when to verify. The result: agents find that buried exclusion in 10 seconds instead of 30 minutes, AND they can see exactly where the answer came from.

## What Makes This Special

**Built FOR insurance agents, not adapted for them.** While generic AI tools bolt on insurance features as an afterthought, docuMINE's accuracy-first architecture was designed from day one for the 95%+ accuracy threshold insurance requires. Source citations on every answer. Confidence scoring that knows when to say "needs review." Insurance-trained understanding of ISO forms, endorsements, and carrier-specific language.

The magic moment: an agent asks "Is flood covered?" and gets the answer in seconds with a direct link to the exact policy language - speed they can feel, accuracy they can verify.
