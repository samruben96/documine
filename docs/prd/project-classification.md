# Project Classification

**Technical Type:** SaaS B2B (Web Application)
**Domain:** InsureTech
**Complexity:** High

This is a B2B SaaS platform serving independent insurance agencies. The web-based delivery model was chosen for simplicity - no installation, works on any device, no IT involvement required for the non-tech-savvy target audience.

The InsureTech domain introduces high complexity due to:
- Accuracy requirements (95%+ for production use, E&O liability implications)
- Document format variability across 15+ carriers
- Insurance-specific terminology, ISO forms, endorsements
- Trust barriers (only 4% of insurance organizations fully trust AI)

## Domain Context

The independent insurance agency market has a critical trust gap with AI. Research shows only 4% of insurance organizations fully trust AI agents, and 95%+ accuracy is required before agents will use tools for client-facing work. Generic AI solutions have burned agents with hallucinations that could create E&O liability exposure.

However, agents desperately need efficiency tools - over 80% of agencies struggle with slow processes leading to lost revenue. The opportunity is solving the trust problem while delivering real productivity gains.

Key domain constraints:
- **E&O Liability:** Incorrect coverage recommendations create legal exposure
- **Verification Required:** Agents must be able to verify any AI output against source documents
- **Carrier Variability:** Different formats, terminology, and coverage structures across carriers
- **Non-Technical Users:** Agency staff are often "old school" and resistant to complex new tools
