# Product Scope

## MVP - Minimum Viable Product

The MVP must prove that docuMINE delivers trustworthy AI for insurance agents. Two high-value capabilities that demonstrate the accuracy-first architecture:

**1. Document Chat / Q&A**
- Upload policy documents, quotes, or any insurance PDF
- Ask questions in plain English: "What's the liability limit?", "Is flood covered?", "What are the exclusions?"
- Get answers with source citations linking to exact document location
- Confidence scoring on every response: [High Confidence], [Needs Review], [Not Found]

**2. Side-by-Side Quote Comparison**
- Upload multiple carrier quotes (2-4 quotes typical)
- Automatically extract and align key data points: coverage types, limits, deductibles, exclusions, premium
- Visual comparison highlighting differences between quotes
- Identify coverage gaps and conflicts

**3. Core Platform**
- User signup and authentication
- Agency/organization account structure
- Document upload and storage
- Simple, clean web interface (no training required)

**MVP Explicitly Excludes:**
- One-pager/summary generation
- Email integration
- AMS integrations
- Custom knowledge bases / URL scraping
- Adaptive learning

## Growth Features (Post-MVP)

**Phase 2: Productivity Expansion**
- **One-pager generation:** Auto-create client-ready comparison summaries from uploaded quotes
- **Email integration (Gmail, Outlook):** Process documents directly from inbox where agents already work
- **Document history:** Access previously analyzed documents and past queries

**Phase 2+: Integration & Intelligence**
- **AMS integration:** Connect to AMS360, EZLynx, Applied Epic, HawkSoft (note: requires agency's own API credentials - "Bring Your Own Key" model)
- **Custom knowledge base:** Upload agency-specific procedures, carrier guidelines
- **URL scraping:** Pull carrier-specific knowledge from carrier websites

## Vision (Future)

**Adaptive Intelligence:**
- Learning from agent corrections and feedback
- Agency-specific pattern recognition
- Company-wide knowledge base building institutional memory
- Proactive insights: flag renewal documents, coverage gaps, policy changes

**Market Expansion:**
- Multi-line support expansion (P&C, Commercial, Life, Health)
- Carrier-specific model fine-tuning
