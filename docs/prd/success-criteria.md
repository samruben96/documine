# Success Criteria

Success for docuMINE means agents trust it enough to use it for client-facing work - and keep coming back because it saves them real time.

**Primary Success Indicators:**

1. **Trust Adoption:** Agents use docuMINE for actual client work (quotes, coverage questions), not just internal exploration. Measured by: ratio of document queries that result in client-facing actions.

2. **Verification Confidence:** Agents click source citations less over time - indicating growing trust in accuracy. Early users verify frequently; mature users trust the output.

3. **Time-to-Answer:** Agents find coverage information in seconds instead of minutes. Target: 90% of common queries answered in under 30 seconds with source citation.

4. **Repeat Usage:** Agents return daily because the tool is genuinely useful. Target: 70%+ weekly active users among paid seats.

5. **Accuracy Threshold:** Maintain 95%+ accuracy on insurance document extraction and Q&A. Below this, agents won't trust it for client work.

**What Success Is NOT:**
- Raw user signups (vanity metric if they don't convert to active use)
- Feature count (agents want simple tools that work, not feature bloat)
- "AI impressiveness" (agents don't care about cool tech - they care about correct answers)

## Business Metrics

**Revenue Model Validation:**
- Seat-based pricing converts: agencies upgrade tiers as more staff adopt
- Retention: agencies renew because productivity gains are measurable
- Expansion: word-of-mouth referrals from satisfied agents (trusted network effects in insurance)

**Unit Economics:**
- Cost per query sustainable at scale (AI inference costs vs. subscription revenue)
- Customer acquisition cost recoverable within first year of subscription
